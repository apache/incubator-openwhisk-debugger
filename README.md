# wskdb: The OpenWhisk Debugger

For documenation on the client, consult [here](client/README.md).

## ** Disclaimer **

According to the author of the debugger, Nick Mitchell, the debugger currently requires **Node 6 to 6.2**.

**Anything higher than 6.3 won't work.**

The community would welcome someone who can help us move this debugger to newer Node versions; however, Nick indicated there were some known issues that prevented him from doing this without large changes.
